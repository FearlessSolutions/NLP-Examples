0, Brexit Timeline Brexit The United Kingdom™s decision to leave the European  Union is one of the most important events in the history  of the European Union  and in the history of the UK™s  relationship with the rest of Europe. The Lisbon Treaty dictates the mechanism by which  the UK can leave the EU. The Treaty allows for up  to 2 years of negotiations. If no agreement has been  reached by this point  all 27 other member states either  have to unanimously agree to extend the negotiation  period  or Britain leaves with no deal in place. As there  is no template for such an event it is likely to be a long  and complex process resulting in a prolonged period   possible exit scenarios currently open to the UK  and their  resultant impact on UK.

Different exit scenarios will affect the extent   of free movement of goods  services and people. Ł Many of the rules established by EU  implemented into  the domestic laws of Member States for application  across the EU  will no longer have effect. E.g.  the zero  rate of  dividend withholding tax  will not apply and UK  parent companies will need to fall back on treaty rates of  withholding.  Ł UK companies operating in the EU and vice versa will need  to review their  VAT  compliance and operations. Ł Trade between the UK and the EU countries will be  recognized as imports and exports.  Customs duties  could add costs through the entire supply chain.  Treasury   Funding Ł  Higher stress on covenants and collateral requirements for  funding of GBP related business. Ł  Sterling liquidity may become limited. Cash management Ł  Some more complex liquidity management solutions should be  reviewed with special attention to banks™ operations in the UK  and in the EU. Foreign Exchange Ł  The recent unprecedent FX volatility is likely to stay or  potentially increase. Additional headges might be needed. Credit risk management Ł  Monitoring  valuation and careful assessment of your client   main topic. Ł  Credit ratings may temporarily be decreased as a result of  uncertainty. Law and legal  Ł Majority of EU law has already been implemented in the  UK law in forms of directives and would not be affected by  Brexit. EU regulations and similar forms are part of UK law  as long as the UK is a member of the EU. However  once UK  leaves EU  it  can be expected that while some laws may  not change  others will be replaced or changed to suit UK  interests. PwC is closely monitoring the changes and likely  impact on the business.  Ł The UK supports the General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR) and it is already giving effect to many of the GDPR™s  requirements. A departure by the UK from its progression  would appear very unlikely.   Ł The UK would not be part of the new European unitary  patent system and separate patents will continue to be  required for UK and rest of Europe. In addition  EU trade  marks will no longer have effect in the UK.  Ł  Brexit. Changes to the enforceability of UK judgments in  EU Member States and greater complexity and uncertainty  surrounding insolvency proceedings can be expected.   Ł Existing group structures may require review as may no  longer continue to have the desired effect following Brexit.  Mobility  Social Security Ł  Social security position of employees coming from other EU  countries to work in the UK and vice versa will be substantially  changed. Costs may increase due to necessity to provide more  comprehensive private medical insurance to employees  dual  liabilities may arise  pension rights may be fragmented and   Mobility Ł  Current freedom of movement rules will continue to apply  until the date of a formal exit. Ł  Exit from the EU could mean the end of the Freedom of  Movement principles. This would impact EU nationals seeking  to exercise their rights to work  study  or simply move to the  UK and also UK nationals wanting to move to or continue to  live/work within the EU. Ł  Although it is widely expected that grandfathering will occur   whereby existing EU migrants would be able to continue to  live and work in the UK  it is still unknown what transitional  arrangements  if any  will be made. Ł  Employers and employees need to be aware that following an  exit  any immigration requirements for EU nationals in the   include burdensome visa and work permit procedures.
